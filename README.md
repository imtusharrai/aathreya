# aathreya

A minimal landing page scaffold (hero, features, CTA) you can open locally.

## What’s included

- `index.html` — the landing page HTML.
- `css/styles.css` — stylesheet (create/extend when implementing styles).
- `js/script.js` — small JS for interactive behaviors (create/extend as needed).

## Open locally

Quick options to view the page:

- Double-click `index.html` in Explorer to open in your default browser.
- Or serve it with a tiny HTTP server (recommended for fetch/XHR and routing):

PowerShell (works if you have Python installed):

```powershell
cd 'C:\Users\rai\Desktop\aathreya'
python -m http.server 5500
# then open http://localhost:5500 in your browser
```

## Development

- Edit `index.html`, `css/styles.css`, and `js/script.js` in the project root.
- After changes, preview in the browser or restart the simple server.

If you want, I can now implement the responsive landing layout (hero, features, CTA), create `css/styles.css` and `js/script.js`, and add a small demo — tell me to proceed and I’ll continue.
